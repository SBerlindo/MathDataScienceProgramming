# Inserting images

Let me show you 
How to insert a picture of switching branches:
   <img src="/assets/images/switching_branches.png" width="500" />.

There is a good documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images 

   
2. But for demo a picture of inserting that picture:
The directory `/assets/images` is used for images.
If it exists, go there:
<img src="/assets/images/goto_asset_images.png" width="500" />.

If it does not exist yet, do this:
1.   <img src="/assets/images/create_file_button.png" width="500" />.
2.   <img src="/assets/images/create_gitkeep.png" width="500" />.


Finally you upload the image like this:
<img src="/assets/images/upload_image.png" width="500" />.
