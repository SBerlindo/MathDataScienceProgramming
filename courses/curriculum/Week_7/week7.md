# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 6

You have seen that mathematics is symbolic construction of proof to find truth given assumtions.
You have been introduced to foundational mathematics of sets and functions.

You also have been introduced to another idea, the technical construction: programming computations in the julia language.

This week you get a glimpse of how difficult it is to use these precise concepts to measure reality, the unknown, the observation of creation. 
How can we create a model of the natural observable world?
What is that, a "model"?
What is uncertainty anyway?
Can we grasp the unprecise precisely?

This week aims at opening a door to data science from a theoretical perspective.
Probability is a difficult and advanced topic -- you will most likely not understand everything.

So, please do not expect "heureka" this week.
Be content with accepting surprise and try to see problems that are not obvious.

Meditate on what you expect from experiments and observations "science", and be puzzled by serious paradoxical issues, which seem not to exist for the ignorant:
Accept that volumes are not as simple as it intuitively seems, and why the Kolmogorov axioms insist that volumes in observation for science are behaving intuitively.

## Basics of Data Science

1. Watch [Probability Primer by mathematical monk](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL17567A1A3F5DB5E4) -- optional: Watch [The Banachâ€“Tarski Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s86-Z-CbaHA).
2. Read Preface and Chapter 1 in [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf) -- optional: read chapter 2
3. Read [Kolmogorov's axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms).
4. Read [Frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) and [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability) interpretation of probability.
