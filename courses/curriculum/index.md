# Curriculum Course Mathematics, Data Science, and Programming (MDSP)
## Curriculum Student Tutors course
 [Week 1](Week 1/week1.md)
 [Week 2](Week 2/week2.md)
 [Week 3](Week 3/week3.md)
 [Week 4](Week 4/week4.md)
 [Week 5](Week 5/week5.md)
 [Week 6](Week 6/week6.md)
 [Week 7](Week 7/week7.md)

## Course Aims:

-   learning essentials:
    -   mathematical notation and proofs
    -   version control for collaboration
-   developing your study program prefering open and freely accessible materials.
-   cocreate curriculum spanning [topics](topics.md): math, data science, & programming

## How will we do this?

The curriculum is created together with prospective student tutors following the Archipel Schedule template with Dr. Kappler supervising a weekly session, and homework is to put together the following materials.

For each course you will study, we

1.  collect and evaluate open course materials (e.g. MIT open courseware <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/>).
2.  collect and evaluate recommended readings, preferably openly accessible.
3.  start compiling important questions, and create a study map what understanding is required to proceed to the answer of a question.
    The goal is to create a guide of prerequisites for studying mathematics/statistics/probability theory enabling recommended and individual learning trajectories.

After reviewing and discussing my suggestion of curriculum content, we assign tasks to compile and discuss material to prospective tutors.
The curriculum content is presented on the collaboration platform <http://github.com> and tasks are assigned there.

###  Format: Zoom

-   no live setting in Lock-Down
    &rarr; we need to adapt!
-   asynchroneous course
    (no lecture series)


## Thursdays recording or mail:

Videos are on Lbry/Odyssee:
https://odysee.com/$/invite/@MathDataScienceProgramming:6

-   commenting
-   explaining homework
-   playing questions & answers,


##  Group WhatsApp

-   as interactive as possible
-   building learning relationsships
-   Participation: will be graded

### Communication Guidelines:

1.  collect yourself, 
    write a brief textual structure of query/reply
    (what exactly do you mean?)
2.  Be
    1.  inventive (before asking a question, search for answers yourself)
    2.  precise (avoid ambiguity of &bdquo;this&ldquo; and no &bdquo;that&ldquo;)
    3.  brief
3.  You are encouraged to record yourself with audio or selfie if you want the question answered in Thursday course recording
    (for more personal communication)

Please reply and help your fellows!
