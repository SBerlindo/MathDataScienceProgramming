# Topics

## Mathematics:

Enables students to master the essential mathematical tools and concepts,
that are elemental for major mathematical specializations.

The curriculum familiarizes with

1.  *Category* Theory to understand elements and functions, and dimensions as cross products,
2.  *Logic* to understand formal mathematical notation, proofs, as well as natural numbers,
3.  *Calculus* to understand the intricacies of continuity,
4.  *Linear Algebra* to master the most simple kind of nontrivial relations.
5.  *Multivariate Calculus*
6.  *Differential Equations*

These concepts are used all over across mathematical research as well as industry.
With this solid foundation you can pursue more advanced topics,
in pure mathematics, as well as applications.

## Data Science:

The curriculum familiarizes with mathematical courses

1.  *Probability Theory* to understand how to observe and estimate beyond the proofable,
2.  *Optimization*
3.  *Statistical Models*

The curriculum teaches how to apply your understanding in these courses

1.  *Data paradigms*: types and tables, dictionaries and databases
2.  *Writing LaTeX*
3.  *Visualizing quantitative information* (Tufte) &#x2013; the grammar of scientific graphics
4.  *Public Data* Science &#x2013; Growing a public data repository for study and research (Information Mycelium).

## Programming:

1.  *Discrete cathematics, the Turing machine and stateful programming*
2.  *Lambda calculus and stateless programming*
3.  *Communication* paradigms: networks, APIs, servers
4.  *Languages* and tools for data science:  *Julia*, (*R*, *Python*)
