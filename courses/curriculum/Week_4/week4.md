## Homework

(materials below)

1. Why is the colloquial term "relation" justified for the Cartesian product *A* x *B* of two sets *A* and *B*?

   *Reply here, use formal notation*.

2. Why is a function a relation?  What special kind of relation is a function?
    
   *Reply here, use formal notation*.

3. Do you agree with "[tertium non datur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)"?
   
   
4. Russel's paradox

   This paradox refuted the first formal set definition of [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege#Work_as_a_logician) (who was spiritually devasted by this).
   
   Why might Gottlob have been so upset about it?

# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 4

You already have had your first Heureka!
Maybe you were not aware...
Take the time to find the tiniest feeling of Heureka-joy by re-reading chapter 10 (Sets).
Make that joy big and strong.
It is earned.

When joy is leaving you:
Take time to think and mentally digest.
Accept frustration. 
Learning takes time.
Walking slow and steady is good.
Only not walking at all means never arriving.

Familiarize yourself! Read up on it and think until it is familiar. 
Learn by heart,
seriously, until you can explain it to your inner child.

You WILL memorize these increasingly over time 
because notation and proof are required to read any other material...



## Functions
Your first steps made you familiar with notation, proof, and sets.

Notation is how you write.
Proof is how you answer "why?", rigorously in notation.
Sets are a formal way to clarify "what?" is talked about.

To know "what" is talked about more clearly, it helps to think about some attributes of "it".
That idea is captured in precise terms as "function".
Read chapter 11 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.

   

## Proof by Contradiction

Read up and meditate on "[tertium non datur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)"?

Read up and meditate on "[ex falso sequitur quodlibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion)" (from the false follows anything).

Read [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox) again.
