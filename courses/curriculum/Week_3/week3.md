Video for week 3: https://youtu.be/U8Ytptb_0VA


## Homework

1. Fork this repository already 
   https://github.com/gkappler/MathDataScienceProgramming/fork
   (adapt bio and train editing in GitHub with copy & pasting your previous homeworks)
   *delete this line for your homework*.
   *put together your own homework notes delete this line for your homework*.

2. Pooh proof
   - What type of proof does Piglet point out?
     *write this line for your homework*.
   - What axioms does Pooh assume for his proof that poor piglet might have doubts about?
    
### Your learning notes of the week:
#### What was easy to understand? 
*Write a topic 
Why?

#### What was hard to understand? 

Why?


#### What do you need to recapitulate?



## Proofs, Part 2
Your first step made you familiar with notation and basics of proof.
Some proofs require multiple steps and cases.

```
There is a story in winnie-the-Pooh by Milne who was a mathematician:
Piglet is a fearful being, and very afraid of the Heffalump.
Pooh wants to help and builds a Heffalump trap: a big hole.

Piglet has doubts that this will work, as a fearful being... and asks for proof.

Pooh proof: 

the heffalump will walk along, and it is a nice day, 
thus the heffalump will look up to the clear sky and think "what a nice day", 
thus not seeing the hole, 
thus woops he is trapped.

Piglet has a doubt: "what if it is raining?"
Pooh: if it is raining, the heffalump will look up to the sky and wonder "when will it clear up?", 
thus not seeing the hole, 
thus woops he is trapped.

Hmmm.
```


To understand Milne's joke understand chapter 5 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.


Notation is how you write.
Proof is how you answer "why?", rigorously in notation.

## Sets

Your next step is clarifying "what?".
What are the elements in addition?

Numbers, for example!
Numbers are a set.

Understand chapter 10 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.

Then you understand a precise way of "what". 
Want to blow your mind more? 
Read up on [Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox).
Learn to use Wikipedia (switch to French, easily learn technical english).

## Functions

To know "what" is talked about more clearly, it helps to think about some attributes of "it".
That idea is captured in precise terms as "function".
Start peeking into chapter 11 in <https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-eps/college/stem/Student-Summer-Education-Internships/Proof-and-Reasoning.pdf>.



If you read thoroughly on proofs you already have had your first Heureka!
Maybe you were not aware...
Take the time to find the tiniest feeling of Heureka-joy by re-reading chapter 1-4.
Make that joy big and strong.
It is earned.

When joy is leaving you:
Take time to think and mentally digest.
Accept frustration. 
Learning takes time.
Walking slow and steady is good.
Only not walking at all means never arriving.

Familiarize yourself! Read up on it and think until it is familiar. 
Learn by heart,
seriously, until you can explain it to your inner child.

You WILL memorize these increasingly over time 
because notation and proof are required to read any other material...
