# Curriculum Course MDSP - Week 6

You have seen that mathematics is more about symbols and construction of ideas than about numbers.
Your first steps made you familiar with notation, proof, sets, and functions.
And made the first step understanding an application of these ideas: programming in the julia language.
This week you learn more concepts in programming: 
- Conditionals
- more about functions returning results, and function composition
- iteration

### Note:
To master programming, you will need to practice coding, writing programs, running programs.
Thus it will be best to organize a computer to learn the programming language julia.


## Basics of programming

1. Read chapter 5-7 in [Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Ben Lauwens)](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html),
2. memorize chapter Glossaries
3. voluntary: If you want to get an idea what relates proof to computation and why there provably exist true statements that are not provable, watch [GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem - Numberphile](https://youtu.be/O4ndIDcDSGc).
