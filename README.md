# Abstract: Mathematics, Data Science, and Programming
are disciplines for

1. provably correct statements
2. making sense of observations, and 
3. controlling computer and machines.

These fields will empower our future.

You can empower your life learning these disciplines!

You are invited to a three day talk series at Archipel University introducing our vision for a new curriculum in these fields.

To an exciting tour through mathematical, scientific and philosophical ideas,
the cornerstones of this big picture of
"mathematics, data science and programming".

Aware of the human condition of uncertainty and confusion,
we lay out a student journey
that promises understanding and possible certainty,
for those who put up with the necessary frustration and pain
of making every proof your own,
until you finally get the ideas.

Beyond numbers we connect fundamental ideas:
introducing simple notation shows
why formal definitions clarify what is talked about,
and rigorous proof reveal certainty.


Learn about the ominous Omega \Omega of creation
Clearly observing and measuring,
About models of reality and the truth.

It is a metareal introduction to the magic of mathematics.
Enroll on a journey where you can expand your mind 
and learn to realize your ideas in a program.
